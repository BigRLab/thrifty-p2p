== thrifty-p2p ==

A very simple p2p python implementation using the Thrift protocol and
its basic RPC capabilities. It is not expected to be generically usable
by arbitrary projects: thrifty-p2p implements a flat network, which is
justifiable for the author's purposes, but will encounter trouble
scaling.

=== Basic usage ===

  python location.py [[peer_node] port_num]

Initiates and/or joins a simple peer-to-peer network. Default port_num
is 9900. Absent a peer_node (which is the peer initially contacted for
joining the network), the command initiates a network.

Example usage, in different terminal windows:
  python location.py
  
  python location.py localhost:9900 9901
  
  python location.py localhost:9901 9902
  
... etc. ...

=== Dependencies & Requirements ===

The basic server uses consistent hashing via hash_ring.py, developed by
Amir Salihefendic. For better and for worse, I modified the code to
allow for easier node set manipulations and different node resolution
behavior so that it's more trivially related to md5 hashes.

The library requires the Apache Thrift Python libraries to be installed,
but does not currently technically require the Thrift compiler or any
other language libraries.

=== Design priorities ===

I'm using Thrift as much for its simple RPC underpinnings as the message
format. I wanted to consistently distribute some processing and bother
as little as possible with node lookup. This is the simplest thing that
I came up with that sort-of works: a flat peer-to-peer network with each
node keeping up with the state of all the nodes as well as it can. This
necessarily limits the ring's ability to scale beyond dozens of nodes.
